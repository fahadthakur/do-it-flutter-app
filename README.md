## About the app

The Do-It! - Task Tracker app provides you with an easy to use interface to keep track of all your pending tasks. 
To start off, users are provided with an introduction screen explaining the functionality of the app. They are prompted to save their username after which they get redirected to the homescreen of the app where they view any existing tasks which have been created.
To create a new task, the user has to click on the green add button. They can then insert a task title, description for the task, deadline for the task. In addition, they can also configure when they would like to be reminded about the task through push notifications. They also have the functionality to add to-do items for that specific task.
When a task has been completed, users can then delete the task from the task page. This will remove the task tile from the homepage.

This is my very first Flutter Application. So all this is still a big learning curve for me. And i hope to improve on the design and UI soon in the future :)
